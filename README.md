A distributed unique ID generator inspired by [Twitter's Snowflake](https://blog.twitter.com/2010/announcing-snowflake).

This is a Rust implementation of the original [sony/sonyflake](https://github.com/sony/sonyflake), which is written in Go.

## Install

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
sonyflake = "0.1"
```

## Quickstart

```rust
use sonyflake::Sonyflake;

let mut sf = Sonyflake::new().unwrap();
let next_id = sf.next_id().unwrap();
println!("{}", next_id);
```
